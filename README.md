# vedauwooBouldering

### Data to do
- [ ] Make a list of all boulder problems: include name, area, sub-area, grade, description, kid friendly, dry easily, stars
- [ ] For each sub area and area make a polygon
- [ ] for each sub area and area make a trail
- [x] link the list of boulder problems to spatial data (if available)
- [x] with test data, convert to json
- [ ] Finish off collecting GPS

### Viz to do
- [x] Add in filters for data
- [x] Can figure out how to subset spatial data based on a filter
- [ ] No clue how to pass something from ag grid
- [ ] Filters for grade: convert all to V scale?
- [ ] Filters: only bring in the filters we actually need. there are a ton of extra options out there currently
- [ ] hide api key (in js)
- [ ] Convert numbers in grade to stars or something cool
- [ ] Add in an about me section
- [ ] For selected routes: highlight leaflet info
- [x] Restrict bounds
- [ ] allow users to right click and select coordinates
- [ ] Maybe have a button to filter to all crack routes or something else?

#### Below I may need python to do
- [ ] For selected routes: export to shapefile
- [ ] Select areas in table (?) and export to shapefile
- [ ] export all data to shapefile


### website to do
- [x] get a url
# NOTE # 
For now, run python -m http.server 8000 in the 'vedauwooBouldering' place and point chrome to localhost:8000
- [ ] Publish on github pages now.. but that seems short term?
- [ ] Do i need django or something to have multiple urls?

### book to do
- [ ] find a template and start pasting in photos
- [ ] Make guidebook sections
- [ ] see if there is a way to recompile book based on updates instead of manually for sections
